# Tic_tac_toe (c++ brain child)
 Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe project! ðŸŽ‰ This game was built using C++ functions and loopsâ€”no classes or objects here. Why? Because this project was part of my CodeAcademy course, where I was diving into functions.  This project is a fun demonstration of what you can do with functions alone. Hope you enjoy playing, and thanks for checking it out!
