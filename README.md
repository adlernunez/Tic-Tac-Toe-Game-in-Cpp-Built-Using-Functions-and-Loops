# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++ ( FUNCTIONS ) 
 Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe project! ðŸŽ‰ This game was built using C++ functions and loopsâ€”no classes or objects here. Why? Because this project was part of my CodeAcademy course, where I was diving into functions.  This project is a fun demonstration of what you can do with functions alone. Hope you enjoy playing, and thanks for checking it out!

## Project Structure
- **`ttt.cpp`**: The main file that includes the game loop and user interaction.
- **`ttt_functions.cpp`**: Contains implementations for the game functions.
- **`ttt.hpp`**: Header file with function declarations and includes.


## How to Compile

To compile the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory containing your project files.

2. **Compile the Project**: Use the following `g++` command to compile the project:

    ```
    g++ ttt.cpp ttt_functions.cpp -o ttt
    ```

    - `ttt.cpp` and `ttt_functions.cpp`: Source files to compile.
   

3. **Run the Executable**: After compilation, run the executable with:

    ```
    ./ttt
    ```

## Project Structure
- **`ttt.cpp`**: The main file that includes the game loop and user interaction.
- **`ttt_functions.cpp`**: Contains implementations for the game functions.
- **`ttt.hpp`**: Header file with function declarations and includes.

## Notes
- Ensure you have `g++` installed on your system. You can download it as part of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) if needed.
- If you encounter any errors, make sure all files are in the same directory and correctly referenced.

Enjoy the game and happy coding!
