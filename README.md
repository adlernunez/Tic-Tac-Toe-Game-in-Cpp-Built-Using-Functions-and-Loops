# Tic_tac_toe (c++ brain child)
 Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe project! 🎉 This game was built using C++ functions and loops—no classes or objects here. Why? Because this project was part of my CodeAcademy course, where I was diving into functions.  This project is a fun demonstration of what you can do with functions alone. Hope you enjoy playing, and thanks for checking it out!

## Project Structure
- **`ttt.cpp`**: The main file that includes the game loop and user interaction.
- **`ttt_functions.cpp`**: Contains implementations for the game functions.
- **`ttt.hpp`**: Header file with function declarations and includes.
